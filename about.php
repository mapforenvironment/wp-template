    <h1>Welcome to Map for Environment!</h1>
    <p>From space, the earth’s great forests and rivers still seem intact and flowing. The Congo Basin
rainforest straddles Africa extending across the continent, regulating the regional climate, providing
food and livelihoods, and home to thousands of species such as elephants and chimpanzees. Asia’s
great rivers – the Mekong, Brahmaputra, the Yangtze, etc – meander from the head waters of the
Himalayas before flowing down to the mouths of Vietnam Delta and the Bangladesh, providing water,
food, and energy to hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>Zoom in further, the threats to these great natural phenomena become apparent. Forests and rivers
face both seen and unseen dangers. Forests are strafed by logging roads, which cut deep in intact
forest areas. The loggers extract valuable timber, feeding ever growing demand for tropical
hardwoods. They provide jobs for a few but when poorly managed, leave the forests vulnerable to
hunting and conversion to agriculture. Hot on their heals, comes industrial agriculture, converting the
degraded land into oil palm, cacoa, and eucalyptus plantations. Asia rivers are increasingly being
dammed to provide energy for rapidly growing cities as well as diverting water to arid regions.
Many of these activities are visible from satellites but unmapped, and their scale and impacts
undocumented. This lack of transparency creates a culture of impunity that allows bad actors to go
unpunished and good actors to go unrecognized. Transparency creates a level playing field.</p>

      <h2>The goal</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>The goal of Map for Environment is to make the invisible visible. We are quite literally aiming to put
logging roads, industrial agriculture, and dams on the map. The availability of high-resolution satellite
information, open data portals such as MapHubs and Global Forest Watch has placed an
unprecedented amount of environmental data in to public domain. OpenStreetMap – the crowdsourced
map of the world – has also built a global community of volunteers mapping the planet. The OSM
community has also pioneered crowd sourced mapping to support humanitarian organizations
responding to disasters such as the Nepal earthquake and the tsunami in the Philippines. Map for
Environment follows this model to map the unmapped but we focus on the humanitarian disaster
slowly unraveling in the world’s critical ecosystems.</p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>Map for Environment uses OpenStreetMap tools - combined with satellite imagery and location data of
known logging, industrial agriculture, and dam locations – to create detailed maps of infrastructure, size, as
well as communities impacted. The information is mapped by volunteers who we teach how to use
OpenStreetMap tools. Mapped data is shared on OpenStreetMap and also
available on MapHubs – an open data repository where users can combine with other data to make
and publish interactive maps. The Map for Environment team uses both open data and expert advice
to direct efforts to dams, logging roads, and industrial agriculture plantations operating in high risk
areas. This is ensures that we make maps that have impact that will directly support advocates and
agencies on the ground hold operators to account for illegal and unsustainable practices.</p>

      <h2>Logging Roads</h2>
      <p>In partnership with Global Forest Watch, The award winning Logging Roads initiative
      (<a href="http://loggingroads.org">loggingroads.org</a>) aims to build a complete and dynamic map of all the world’s logging roads,
      particularly focused in the tropics. With the support of volunteers, Logging Roads has already mapped
      more than 30,000 roads with over 12,000 user edits in the Congo Basin. This data supports forest
      monitors identify violations by logging companies, encroachment into indigenous people’s territories,
      and risks to wildlife conservation.</a></p>

      <h2>Industrial Agriculture</h2>
      <p>Map for Environment aims to map all industrial agriculture operating in or near the tropics with a
        specific focus on oil palm in Indonesia and the Congo Basin. Oil palm plantations, in particular,have
        decimated rainforest in Sumatra and Borneo, creating conflicts with indigenous communities and
        clearing habitat for the endanger orangutan and tiger populations. But despite their enormous impact,
        very few plantations and their associated infrastructure such as mills have been mapped.</p>
