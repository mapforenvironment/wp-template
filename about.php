    <p>
      From space, the earth’s great forests and rivers still seem intact and flowing. The Congo Basin rainforest straddles Africa extending across the continent, regulating the regional climate, providing food and livelihoods to millions, and refuge to thousands of species including forest elephants and chimpanzees.

      Asia’s great rivers – the Mekong, Brahmaputra, the Yangtze, etc – meander from the head waters of the Himalayas before flowing down to the mouths of Vietnam Delta and the Bangladesh, providing water, food, and energy to hundreds of millions of people. And the vast plains of the Dakotas still remain some of most vast unpopulated regions of the United States.

      Zoom in further, the threats to these great natural phenomena become apparent. Forests and rivers face both seen and unseen dangers. Forests are strafed by logging roads, which cut deep in intact forest areas. The loggers extract valuable timber, feeding ever growing demand for tropical hardwoods. They provide jobs for a few but when poorly managed, leave the forests vulnerable to hunting and conversion to agriculture.

    <p>
      Hot on their heels, comes industrial agriculture, converting the degraded land into oil palm, cacao, and eucalyptus plantations. Asia rivers are increasingly being dammed to provide energy for rapidly growing cities as well as diverting water to arid regions. And fracking sites dot the plains across the North America. Many of these activities are visible from satellites but unmapped, and their scale and impacts undocumented. This lack of transparency creates a culture of impunity that allows bad actors to go unpunished and good actors to go unrecognized.

    <h2>The goal</h2>
    <p>Map for Environment’s aim is to quite literally put logging roads, industrial agriculture, dams, and fracking on the map. The availability of high-resolution satellite information, open data portals such as Global Forest Watch (<a href="http://globalforestwatch.org" target="_blank">globalforestwatch.org</a>) and MapHubs (<a href="https://maphubs.com" target="_blank">maphubs.com</a>) has placed an unprecedented amount of environmental data in to public domain. OpenStreetMap (<a href="http://openstreetmap.org" target="_blank">openstreetmap.org</a>) – the crowdsourced map of the world – has also built a global community of volunteers mapping the planet.</p>

    </div>
    <p>The OSM community has pioneered crowd sourced mapping to support humanitarian organizations responding to disasters such as the Nepal earthquake and the 2013 Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan in the Philippines. Map for Environment follows this model to map the unmapped environmmental disaster slowly unraveling in the world’s critical ecosystems.</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Map for Environment combines OpenStreetMap mapping tools with satellite imagery and location data of known logging, industrial agriculture, dam, and fracking locations to create detailed maps of infrastructure, size, as well as communities impacted. The information is mapped by OpenStreetMap users. Mapped data is shared on OpenStreetMap and will also available on MapHubs – a simple-to-use interactive map publishing platform.</p>

    </div>
    <p>The Map for Environment team uses both open data and expert advice to direct efforts to maps dams, logging roads, industrial agriculture plantations, and fracking sites operating in high risk areas. This is ensures that we make high impact maps that directly support advocates and agencies holding operators accountable for illegal, unsustainable, and dangerous practices.</p>

    <h2>Join Us</h2>
    <h4>There are lots of ways you can get involved with Map for Environment.</h4>
    <h3 style="padding: 0px;">Help map!</h3>
    <p>Anyone can help map by creating an OpenStreetMap account, learn the basics, and taking on a mapping task. It takes no time at all to begin actively mapping and making an important contribution to environmental conservation efforts.</p>
    <h3 style="padding: 0px;">Host a mapping party!</h3>
    <p>Do you have some space to accommodate some eager mappers and an internet connection? They you could be a mapping party host! Mapping parties are a great way to accomplish a mapping task and meet fellow mappers. Providing some beers and pizza goes a long way too. Please contact us, if you are interested in hosting a party.</p>
    <h3 style="padding: 0px;">Become a partner!</h3>
    <p>Map for Environment is completely run by volunteers. If you would like to provide financial or technical support to the project, please contact us here. Funding helps us improve the tools, sponsor mapping parties in places like DRC and Indonesia and helps us obtain proprietary high resolution imagery, which is critical to mapping. If you would like to sponsor Map for Environment, please contact us.</p>
