    <h3 style="padding-bottom: 0px;">WHY MAP INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE</h3>
    <iframe class="maphubs-map" src="https://maphubs.com/map/embed/210/static#10.13/3.7488/9.9127" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>Industrial agriculture is the single biggest cause of deforestation in Amazon and Indonesian rainforest. The expansion of oil palm, eucalyptus, soyabean, cacao, and host of other commodities have razed millions of hectares primary rainforest. In Indonesia, clearance has become so extensive that the International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified the orangutan as <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2016/07/bornean-orangutan-declared-critically-endangered-as-forests-shrink/">critically endangered</a> - the highest risk extinction in the wild.</p>
    <p>While the companies and governments of the Indonesia, Amazonia, and now the Congo Basin have made some efforts to establish regulations to slow deforestation, forest loss still remains high. </p>

    </div>
    <p>The problem is greatly exacerbated by a lack of accurate maps. Plantation boundaries often change constantly or are not mapped at all, making establishing culpability for illegal clearance difficult. When monitors do visit, they rely upon maps provide by the company who also control access to plantations along private roads. While satellite images can help, cloud cover greatly reduces the availability of high resolution satellite images and remote products are no substitute for field-based monitors collecting information on the ground. </p>

    </div>
    <p>Effective mapping needs a combination of satellite imagery, plantation area maps, and field observations. Strong field to satellite monitoring can shine a spotlight on industrial agriculture operating in rainforest regions. </p>
    <p>Maps can define the boundaries of agriculture plantations, identifying overlapping land titles, and monitor illegal encroachment. Accurately mapped plantations can also improve the accuracy of forest alert systems such as Global Land Analysis and Discovery or GLAD alerts, which cannot distinguish between clearance of natural forest and former plantation. </p>
    <p>Carefully collected, mapping information provides a critical evidence for prosecuting environmental crimes and keeping supply chains deforestation free. Maps can also help compliant actors, whether smallholders or multinational, companies, prove that their supply chains do not result in deforestation. </p>

    <h3 style="padding-bottom: 0px;">OUR AIM</h3>
    <p>Our immediate goal is to build detailed maps of high priority agricultural plantations with a specific focus on Indonesia and the Congo Basin. By combining data such as plantation boundaries, forest loss alerts, and satellite imagery, we have identified active agriculture plantations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see here). None of the plantations have been mapped in OpenStreetMap nor mapped by the government. </p>

  <div class="row wp2">
    <h3 style="padding-bottom: 0px;">HOW?</h3>
    <p>To effectively map industrial agriculture, we need a range of different datasets:</p>
    <ol style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #646464; font-weight: 200;">
      <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><b>Partnerships on the ground</b> - Working with partners on the ground, we identify high priority plantations to map. This may be plantations where there are indications of primary forest clearance, endangered species, or community grievances with the operator.</li>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><b>Source satellite imagery</b>  - from providers such as Planet Labs, DigitalGlobe, as well as the free Landsat archive</li>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><b>Mapathons</b>  - Once identified, tasks will be created in tasking manager, and a call is sent out to the Map for Environment community to map theses areas. We will also organize mapathons with our partners in country.</li>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><b>Publish maps and disseminate</b>  - Once we have mapped the plantations, maps will be made in MapHubs (<a href="https://maphubs.com">maphubs.com</a>) and available for anyone to use. They will disseminated to government regulatory agencies, advocacy groups as well as the companies involved.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 style="padding-bottom: 0px;">THE BENEFITS</h3>
    <p>There are many benefits to mapping industrial agriculture:</p>
    <ol style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #646464; font-weight: 200;">
      <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><b>Stronger monitoring</b> - monitors visiting plantations will have their own detailed maps of plantation sites, so they are not reliant on one’s provided by the companies.</li>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><b>Improved forest alerts</b> - detailed plantation maps will improve the accuracy of deforestation alerts because we can mask out clearances of old plantation from natural forest clearance.</li>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><b>Fines</b> - many lucrative markets such as the US, EU, and Australia have regulations on the importation of illegally sourced timber and oil palm. Accurate maps will add to evidence being used Justice departments bringing cases against violations.</li>
      <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><b>More accountability</b> - As companies become aware that they are being watched, this can lead to improved behavior, particularly if there is a stronger risk of fines or even closure by enforcement authorities.</li>
    </ol>
